This project is realized for [start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/)'s module "Javascript Basics" in Front-End developer course.

## The assignment: 
The assigment of this project was to create a counter. An app which allows the user to increase o decrease the value.
As soon as the users enters the page, will see the starting value of the counter, wich will be 0. 
The users will have two buttons +/- available to change the value of the counter. Following some examples seen on the internet,I also added the Restet button to be able to reset the counter.

## The Idea:
For the theme, I wantes to use a starry background with the mountains. As soon as the users clicks on the button +, they will see a shooting star, Instead if you click the button -, the star will come back.
I made this animation using the JavaScript library "anime.js".
